          <h1>WARNING REGARDING THE RISKS OF EXCESSIVE GAMBLING AND/OR BETTING</h1>
          <p>aviator.com would like to emphasize the potential dangers associated with excessive gambling and/or betting.</p>
          <p>By placing a bet, the bettor acknowledges that they are aware of this warning.</p>
          <p>aviator.com fully supports the principles of responsible gambling, where the participant takes personal responsibility for controlling their betting activities to avoid any potential negative consequences related to gambling addiction. It is crucial to recognize that betting is meant for entertainment and leisure purposes only, and it should not be viewed as a source of income. Betting relies solely on the probability of outcomes, and both the participant and aviator.com accept that their rights and obligations are subject to external circumstances beyond their control.</p>
          <h2>GENERAL TERMS</h2>
          <ul class="lisp-policy"> 
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>1. </span> aviator.com accepts bets on sports events only (hereinafter referred to as "events"). All bets are accepted strictly in accordance with these rules and the laws of the United Kingdom, and by placing a bet, the participant confirms their awareness of these rules and full agreement with them.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>2. </span> aviator.com reserves the right to modify and add to the rules, regulations, and payment procedures outlined here without providing personal prior notification. However, conditions for previously placed bets remain unchanged, and all subsequent bets will be subject to the updated rules. Changes and additions to the rules may be adopted in a new edition.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>3. </span> Registration, deposit opening, and betting are only permitted for individuals who are 21 years of age or older and can present identification documents (such as a passport or identity card). Participants are fully responsible for ensuring that online gambling is legal in their region of residence and for reporting their winnings or losses to the appropriate authorities in their respective countries.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>4. </span> By registering, the player consents to being identified by aviator.com and agrees to provide the casino with accurate personal information and relevant documents for verification. Additionally, players may be asked to complete and submit a "Know Your Customer" questionnaire and grant consent for the collection and processing of personal data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To prevent fraud and potential conflicts, aviator.com may require clients to confirm their identity and authenticity of the information provided. Clients must be willing to provide any necessary documents upon request from aviator.com.</p>
          <ul class="lisp-policy"> 
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>1. </span> In cases of fraudulent financial transactions and acceptance of bets, the perpetrator will be subject to legal consequences, including potential criminal charges.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>2. </span> Account opening and funding must adhere to the rules specified for these processes.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>3. </span> The moment of winning is considered to be the point when the player requests the payout of their winnings from aviator.com, and the actual payment is made by the casino. Payouts are made in accordance with the rules for calculating bets and withdrawing funds from the gaming account. It's important to note that, in accordance with UK tax legislation, winnings are considered income and are subject to individual income tax at a rate of 10%. Thus, aviator.com, as a tax agent, deducts and transfers the applicable tax amount from the winnings when it is paid to the player.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>4. </span> The client bears sole responsibility for the security of their account and password. aviator.com guarantees the confidentiality of client data by its employees and is not liable for any consequences arising from the client's secret data being accessed by unauthorized individuals, except where mandated by law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All operations confirmed through the login/account number and password of the account holder are considered valid and legally binding, with the only restriction being the current balance of the gaming account. If the client suspects any compromise of this information, they have the right to request a password change by contacting the administration of aviator.com.</p>
          <ul class="lisp-policy"> 
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>1. </span> aviator.com assumes no responsibility for any damages or losses claimed to have been incurred due to the use of this site or arising from its content.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>2. </span> This provision applies equally to the use or misuse of the site's content by any person, difficulties in connecting to or using the site, delays in its operation or data transmission, failures in communication lines, errors, typos, or omissions in the content of the site.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>3. </span> The rules specific to sports betting take precedence over general rules.</li>
            <li class="lisp-policy__elm"><span>4. </span> While aviator.com strives to ensure the accuracy of the site's content, all data regarding the current status of events is purely informational. aviator.com disclaims any responsibility for potential inaccuracies in the live score of a match or event timing. The betting network recommends cross-referencing with alternative sources of information for verification.</li>
